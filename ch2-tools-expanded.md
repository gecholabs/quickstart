# CH 2 - **Tools expanded**

## **Package Managers - use one, seriously just do it!**

**I currently use four package managers:    
**

**Homebrew**

Manages the setup of your entire Mac

**Conda**

Manages packages \(especially Python\) in your Anaconda environment \(curated by Anaconda - formerly Continuum IO - a software company\).**    
**

**Pip**

Manages Python across your machine \(curated by Python community\)**    
**

**NPM**

Manages your Node.js javascript packages

**There are more coming down the pipe, but it is worth using these for now.**
