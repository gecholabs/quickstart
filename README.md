# Introduction

### **Why learn the “full-stack”?**

The “stack” describes the components and tools with which a practicing data scientist interacts from end-to-end: spanning servers to visualizations and everything in between. There are specialist trades along on the way e.g., devops engineers, UX designers, analysts, programmers, DBAs, software engineers … the list is long. I don’t claim to know all the things, but I’ve managed teams on large data science projects that cover most areas.

For managers or founders cultivating projects in this space, I believe that it is worthwhile to be versed in the technologies and/or being able to rapidly prototype your ideas. That said, you don’t need to know all the parts to get underway; I’ll try to setup the guide to allow you to jump into the sections of interest. Youshouldinstall the “core setup” to get your laptop operational and so the sections of the guide are not repetitive.

### **Opinions**

I express strongly held opinions in this guide. There are many ways to skin a cat but I’ve found the tools I describe to be effective and work well together. These will provide a good starting point for your data explorations; however, you may eventually come to prefer alternative editors, package managers, etc… and the landscape is constantly evolving.**

### **Core components?**

To explore data science, you need the following capabilities \(**warning** opinionated\):

#### 1. Package Manager

to install and manage software

**Recommendation**: Homebrew works well for Macs

#### 2. Scripting language

to shape, analyze, and display data

**Recommendation**: Pythonis versatile \(e.g. stats, maps, models, text, etc..\)

#### 3. Code editor

to write and edit code

**Recommendation**: Atom is extensible, reliable, and intuitive

#### 4. Versioning to “save” snapshots of your work history and collaborate

**Recommendation**: Git is distributed and builds reproducibility

#### 5. Lab book

to explore data and annotate your work

**Recommendation**: Jupyter is popular, supports inline graphs, and is multilingual

...everything else is pretty much optional



**TL;DR** this is a choose-your-own-adventure guide to data science; please cherry pick and choose per your interests, but do install the core components first \(Homebrew, Python, Atom, Git, and Jupyter\)!**

**Caveats**

* Installation guides go out-of-datequickly. I’ll try to keep up but any help would be appreciated.

* This is Mac specific, I no longer have cycles for Windows or Linux

* Installing things can damage your laptop, I recommend package managers wherever possible to not clobber your settings or bare metal OS. The install scripts in this guide are open on Github to scrutinize, fork, or clone if concerned

* I’m writing this guide quickly, some sources may not be properly referenced

* Blanket acknowledgement \(Source = “The Interwebs.”\)
