# Introduction

### **Why learn the “full-stack” for data science?**

The “stack” describes the components and tools with which a practicing data scientist interacts from end-to-end, from servers to visualizations and everything in between. There are specialist trades along on the way e.g., devops engineers, UX designers, analysts, programmers, DBAs, software engineers … the list is long. This guide is not a source of expertise on each of these trades; however, I've managed teams on large data science projects that cover most areas and through this guide seek to share ways to combing these capabilities to tackle real world problems.

For managers or founders cultivating projects in this space, it is worthwhile to be versed in the technologies at a high level and/or to be able to rapidly prototype your ideas. You don’t need to know all the parts to get underway,and I’ll try to setup the guide to allow you to jump into the sections of interest. The chapters are not compeletely autonomous, the "core setup" is relevant to all chapters and is provided seperately to avoid repetition.  You should install the “core setup” first to get your laptop operational.

### **Opinions**

I express strongly held opinions in this guide. There are many ways to skin a cat but I’ve found the tools I describe to be effective and they work well together. These will provide a good starting point for your data adventures; however, you may eventually come to prefer alternative editors, package managers, etc… and the landscape is constantly evolving.**    **

### **Core components?**

To explore data science, you need the following capabilities \(**warning** opinionated\):

#### 1. Package Manager

... _to_ install and manage software

**Recommendation**: Homebrew works well for Macs

#### 2. Scripting language

... _to_ shape, analyze, and display data

**Recommendation**: Pythonis versatile \(e.g. stats, maps, models, text, etc..\)

#### 3. Code editor

... _to_ write and edit code

**Recommendation**: Atom is extensible, reliable, and intuitive

#### 4. Versioning

... _to_ “save” snapshots of your work history and collaborate

**Recommendation**: Git is distributed and builds reproducibility

#### 5. Lab book

... _to_ explore data and annotate your work

**Recommendation**: Jupyter is popular, supports inline graphs, and is multilingual

...everything else is pretty much optional

**TL;DR** this is a choose-your-own-adventure guide to data science; please cherry pick and choose according to your interests and needs. Install the core components first \(Homebrew, Python, Atom, Git, and Jupyter\) they are necessary for all chapters!**    **

**Caveats**

* Installation guides go out-of-date quickly. I’ll try to keep up but any help would be appreciated.

* This is Mac specific, I no longer have the cycles for Windows or Linux

* Installing things can damage your laptop, I recommend package managers wherever possible to not clobber your settings or bare metal operating system. I'll try to post the install scripts in this guide on Github for you to scrutinize, fork, or clone

* I’ve been writing this guide quickly, some sources may not be properly referenced

* Blanket acknowledgement \(Source = “The Interwebs.”\)
