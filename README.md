# Introduction

### **Why the “full-stack” \(wtf\)?**

The “stack” describes the technical components and tools with which you interact from end-to-end, from servers to visualizations and everything in between. There are specialist trades along on the way e.g., DevOps engineers, User Experience \(UX\) designers, analysts, programmers, Data Base Administrators \(DBAs\), software engineers … the list is long. This guide is not a source of expertise on each of these trades; however, I've managed teams on large technical projects that cover most areas and through this guide seek to share ways to combing these capabilities to tackle real world problems.

For managers or founders cultivating projects in this space, it is worthwhile to be versed in the technologies at a high level and/or to be able to rapidly prototype your ideas. You don’t need to know all the parts to get underway, and I’ll try to setup the guide to allow you to jump into the sections of interest. The chapters are not completely autonomous, the "core setup" is relevant to all chapters and is provided separately to avoid repetition.  You should install the “core setup” first to get your laptop operational.

### **Opinions**

I express strongly held opinions in this guide. There are many ways to skin a cat but over time I’ve found the tools described here to be effective and they work well together. They provide a start point for your data adventures; however, you may eventually come to prefer alternative editors, package managers, etc… and the landscape is constantly evolving.**    **

### **Core components?**

To explore data science, you need the following capabilities \(**warning** opinionated\):

#### 1. Package Manager

... _to_ install and manage software

**Recommendation**: Homebrew works well for Macs

#### 2. Scripting language

... _to_ shape, analyze, and display data

**Recommendation**: Python is versatile \(e.g. stats, maps, models, text, etc..\)

#### 3. Code editor

... _to_ write and edit code

**Recommendation**: Atom is extensible, reliable, and intuitive

#### 4. Versioning

... _to_ “save” snapshots of your work history and collaborate

**Recommendation**: Git is distributed and promotes reusibility

#### 5. Lab book

... _to_ explore data and annotate your work

**Recommendation**: Jupyter supports inline graphs, multiple programming languages, and is easy to share and use

...everything else is pretty much optional

**TL;DR** this is a choose-your-own-adventure guide to data science; please pick and choose according to your interests and needs. Install the core components first \(Homebrew, Python, Atom, Git, and Jupyter\) they are necessary for all chapters!

#### **Caveats**

* Installation guides go out-of-date quickly. I try to keep up but help is appreciated \(e.g. Github issue reports or email\)

* This is Mac specific; unfortunately, I no longer have the cycles for Windows or Linux

* Installing things can damage your laptop, I recommend package managers wherever possible to not clobber your settings or bare metal operating system. I'll eventually post to Github the install scripts to build the software in this guide

* I’ve been writing this guide quickly, some sources may not be properly referenced, blanket acknowledgement for sources = “The Interwebs.”
