# CH 1 - **Package Managers **

**Use one, seriously just do it!**

I currently use four differnt package managers for data science:

### 0\) **Homebrew**

Manages the setup of your entire Mac. Totally invaluable and leaves your system setting untouched.

### 1\) **Conda**

Manages packages \(especially Python\) in your Anaconda environment \(curated by Anaconda - formerly Continuum IO\).**    **

### 2\) **Pip**

Manages Python across your machine \(curated by Python community\)**    **

### 3\) **NPM**

Manages your Node.js javascript packages

There are more coming down the pipe, and referenced in this guide, but it is worth using these for now.
