which a practicing data scientist interacts from end-to-end, from servers to visualizations and everything in between. There are specialist trades along on the way e.g., devops engineers, UX designers, analysts, programmers, DBAs, software engineers … the list is long. This guide is not a source of expertise on each of these trades; however, I've managed teams on large data science projects that cover most areas and through this guide seek to share ways to combing these capabilities to tackle real world problems.\nFor managers or founders cultivating projects in this space, it is worthwhile to be versed in the technologies at a high level and/or to be able to rapidly prototype your ideas. You don’t need to know all the parts to get underway,and I’ll try to setup the guide to allow you to jump into the sections of interest. The chapters are not compeletely autonomous, the \"core setup\" is relevant to all chapters and is provided seperately to avoid repetition.  You should install the “core setup” first to get your laptop operational.\nOpinions\nI express strongly held opinions in this guide. There are many ways to skin a cat but over time I’ve found the tools described here to be effective and they work well together. They provide a start point for your data adventures; however, you may eventually come to prefer alternative editors, package managers, etc… and the landscape is constantly evolving.    \nCore components?\nTo explore data science, you need the following capabilities (warning opinionated):\n1. Package Manager\n... to install and manage software\nRecommendation: Homebrew works well for Macs\n2. Scripting language\n... to shape, analyze, and display data\nRecommendation: Python is versatile (e.g. stats, maps, models, text, etc..)\n3. Code editor\n... to write and edit code\nRecommendation: Atom is extensible, reliable, and intuitive\n4. Versioning\n... to “save” snapshots of your work history and collaborate\nRecommendation: Git is distributed and promotes reusibility\n5. Lab book\n... to explore data and annotate your work\nRecommendation: Jupyter supports inline graphs, multiple programming languages, and is easy to share and use\n...everything else is pretty much optional\nTL;DR this is a choose-your-own-adventure guide to data science; please pick and choose according to your interests and needs. Install the core components first (Homebrew, Python, Atom, Git, and Jupyter) they are necessary for all chapters!\nCaveats\n\nInstallation guides go out-of-date quickly. I try to keep up but help is appreciated (e.g. Github issue reports or emails)\n\nThis is Mac specific; unfortunately, I no longer have the cycles for Windows or Linux\n\nInstalling things can damage your laptop, I recommend package managers wherever possible to not clobber your settings or bare metal operating system. I'll eventually post to Github the install scripts to build the software in this guide\n\nI’ve been writing this guide quickly, some sources may not be properly referenced, blanket acknowledgement for sources = “The Interwebs.”\n\n\nGuide to the Guide\nCode is embedded in a grey box from which to copy and paste\necho \"hello world\"\n"},"ch0-getting-started.html":{"url":"ch0-getting-started.html","title":"CH0 - Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"CH 0 - Getting Started\n\nChapter Contents:\n0) Core setup for your Mac (Quickstart)\n1) Package Manager (Homebrew)\n2) Scripting language (Python - Anaconda distro)\n3) Version Control (Git)\n4) Code Editor (Atom)\n5) Lab notebook (Jupyter)\n\n0) Core setup for your Mac (Quickstart)\nOptions to open your terminal:\n\nPress CMD⌘+spacebar and typing “terminal” in Spotlight Search (hint: it autocompletes as \"Terminal.app\" ... so you can press enter after typing the first few letters e.g. \"te\")\n\nClick on \"terminal\" in your dock      \n\nOpening “Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app” in Finder\n\n\nTerminal looks like this:\n\nYours may be transparent and the fonts may be small.

Almost every website you visit is run by a Linux-flavored server. One of the best features of Linux are the package managers. Think of a package as being an “application” or “program that you install, that can range from a full text editor (atom) or scripting language (e.g. Python) to a helper script that auto-completes code for you.\nThe benefit of package managers is that if you can keep your code separate from your operating system (OS) and other software. Otherwise, as you install stuff you could clobber your machine settings, slow things down, or introduce error to other projects due to dependency issues. A package manager keeps software installations separate. For example, by default, software installed by Homebrew is put in the folder /usr/local/cellar.\nYou can remove Homebrew and all the dependencies anytime you want without affecting your machine. You can also rebuild your software environment on other machines and get your team synchronized.\nTo install Homebrew\n\nFrom Homebrew.com\n\n# Install and update homebrew\nruby -e\"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install\\)\"\nbrew update\nbrew upgrade\n\n#list Homebrew installed software \nls /usr/local/cellar\n\n2) Scripting language (Python - Anaconda distro)\nI’m hesitant to recommend a particular vendor, but installing Python for scientific computing can be a challange. The Anaconda folks have resolved many of headaches (e.g. SciPy installation)\n\nFrom https://www.continuum.io/downloads\n\n#install anaconda python with Homebrew\nbrew cask install Anaconda\nThe install takes a few minutes and ~3 GB\nThere is an alternative miniconda package that is minimalist and installs more quickly; however, it doesn’t have the scientific packages (the main benefit of Anaconda IMHO).\nThe alternative way to install python is to use Homebrew and Pip for the dependencies. This can lead to trip ups with dependencies SciPy. To resolve these you’ll need to get good at reading error messages. The best way to solve these is to paste the error message into Stack Overflow\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/\nOther users will suggest ways to resolve the dependency. Look for the solutions with the highest number of votes.\nHere is a quick guide to getting started with Anaconda Python\nhttps://conda.io/docs/test-drive.html\n3) Version Control (Git)\nVersioning is essential to good code management. You’ve probably heard of GitHub, which is where almost all open source software is developed. However, the public code you find is this is just the tip of the iceberg, lots of business manage their code in private GitHub or GitLab repositories. Also you should check the license before you use code (look for a LICENSE file), just because it is on Github does not mean it is open source.\nFrom https://github.com/explore\n            \nTo install:\n# install Git\nbrew install git\nGit is a distributed version control system. The basic concept is like playing a video game, when you are about the face the boss at the end of a level you might save your game, as “savegame1”, then if you fail you may go back to that, at the next boss you might “savegame2”, etc… This creates a confusing chain of semi-meaningful names. Now you may need to revert to one of these previous versions as you advance, but the nomenclature (arbitrary numbering) quickly gets out of hand.\nWith Git you can make a “commit” (~save) as you work and type a “commit message” to remind yourself, and others, of what you did. You can also create a “branch” of your code, that won’t affect the main code, but is where you are develop a new feature. Importantly, you can easily collaborate with others. Just like Google Docs revolutionized the way we edit docs, you can all be working on the same code base; however, you wouldn’t want edits by others edits to suddenly jump into your code and break things. So, there are cultural practices to how the code is managed and merged, as well as gate keepers to the Master branch. Essentially, you can work in separate branches, named for the functionality they are adding (e.g. “fixing analysis bug”), when you are ready you propose a “pull request” to a Master branch in the main repo to be peer reviewed and merged by your collaborators. We’ll discuss social coding practices and conventions later. Note that Git can be used for more than just code, you can manage many file types like images, data, and documents. This is useful for building a web site but also can be used to write books like this Guide (written with Gitbook).\nTo create a git repository in a folder\ngit init\nThat will create a tiny system file (“.git”) that manages all the \"saves\" of your code. Here is an intro guide to help you get started with Git:\nhttp://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/\n\n4) Code Editor (Atom)\n\nCode editors are like tricked out word processors (e.g. MS Word or Pages) with features like syntax highlighting, pretty layouts, autocompletion, and packages to add language specific enhancements.\nTo install\n# Install Atom with homebrew\nbrew cask install atom\nAdvantages\n\nBuilt in editors are minimalist and obscure (e.g. Nano, Pico); you need a tutorial just to figure out how to insert edits or exit the editor.\n\nPower editors (e.g. Emacs, Vim) have a steep learning curve, are a gazillion years old, and require constant configuration maintenance. That said, they’re awesome, retro, and nerdy so check them out sometime.\n\nAtom mostly works out of the box\n\nIt is future friendly and browser based, e.g. usable on Google Chromebook and browser-only devices\n\nIt’s future relevant as social coding moves to the web/cloud\n\n\nTips\n\nFolder view on the left side is great for seeing your whole project\n\nYou can add packages to enhance Atom via Packages>Settings View>Manage Packages\n\nAs of 2017, you can manage your Git/Github interactions directly through Atom with a popout view on the right side that shows changes, commits, and staged file. It can be a great way to diff and merge branches.\n\nLaunch a folder (e.g. myworkfolder) in atom directly from the terminal\n\n\natom myworkfolder\n5) Lab notebook (Jupyter)\nJupyter notebooks come pre-bundled with Anaconda. They are a revelation in a data scientist's workflow. If you are figuring out a problem and want to know where to start, you could probably find a publicly hosted notebook laying out all the steps. Copying (forking) and modifying these shared notebooks is a great way to get started with your own coding adventures.\nTo install\njupyter notebook\nThis launches a notebook in your web browser. You should read the messages in terminal after running the “jupyter notebook” command. It may suggest you paste a web address into your browser to launch the notebook, e.g. http://localhost:8888\nJupyter notebooks have revolutionized my workflow. The difference between these and a code editor (e.g. Atom), is that you can work on an endless scroll, chasing down data trends like a stream of consciousness and leaving notes for yourself on what you’ve tried. You can also embed graphics and other outputs inline, so you don’t need to have multiple windows open. Lastly, they are easy to share with colleagues. You can even setup a centralized server in your office with JupyterHub.\nYou’ll eventually probably tidy up your code into a series of files, perhaps minifying (minimizing) or optimizing your code. This is a natural evolution.\nYou can find gazillions of fully-annotated Jupyter notebooks in the wild, in places like GitHub.\n\n"},"ch1-package-managers.html":{"url":"ch1-package-managers.html","title":"CH1 - Package Managers","keywords":"","body":"CH 1 - Package Managers \nUse one, seriously just do it!\nPackage managers are used to easily install packages (software) on your machine. I use package managers extensively while working with Linux operating systems. Recently, some good variants have become available to Mac OS; this has been a game changer. Packages help ensure software is interoperable. A frequent challenge for new Linux users is compiling code, e.g. turning raw code into a functional application. Usually the user runs in a series of failed compiles; requiring them to decipher cryptic error messages then compile missing dependencies. With package managers, user benefits from the community (crowd) working together to package software and resolve depedencies. Another benefit is that the packages can be kept seperate from the software with which  your machine ships. For example, your Mac ships with Python, while you can change or upgrade the core Python installation,  this can introduce issues with other software on your system. By installing in a new isolated directory (e.g. usr/local/cellar) you can install, uninstall, and switch between versions of software.\nThis phenomenon is imporant for the reproducibility of a scientist's work. For instance, you may develop an analysis that uses multiple libraries to run, then update software for some other application, and suddenly your code won't load or, worse, the software returns subtly different results. Package managers help partially in this situation, since you can easily roll back the version and its dependencies; however, a true solution also requires containers that freeze the versions of the code used for the analysis. These containers can  be run years later with the same old code versions and consistent results. We will discuss containerization in a later section. For now, we will discuss using package managers to facilitate loading software and protecting your core system from side effects.\nAnother aspect of reproducibility is ensuring consistent results across machines and rapidly setting up new machines. You can install this software with simple shell scripts that run in the terminal and  can be managed by a lab group and shared with everyone on the team. If you change laptops you can quickly get up an running again or help setup your colleagues and students. I keep a record of all the software I install in a large batch file. I'll clean up and share this file in a later version. Essentially, it looks something like this:\n# Useful binaries\nbinaries=(\n  ack\n  boot2docker\n  git\n  graphicsmagick\n  mongo\n  node\n  phantomjs\n  python\n)\n\n# Install the binaries\nbrew install ${binaries[@]}\nI currently use four different package managers for data science:\n0) Homebrew\nManages the setup of your entire Mac. Homebrew is invaluable and leaves your system settings untouched. Homebrew is called the \"missing package manager for Mac OSx.\" It is a beer themed package management system. You tap a repository to access files.\nTo check on the health of your packaged, e.g. check for updates and verify configuration use\nbrew doctor\nYou can usually ignore any warnings, they are just a suggestion. If something needs fixing Brew Doctor will give you the command you need to run. Most of these are safe to run. It is very satisfying to have a clean bill of health from the Brew Doctors.\nTo maintain your home brew, these commands are usually run together\nbrew update && brew upgrade\nTo install software use the syntax brew install XYZ, e.g.\nbrew install python\nTo uninstall software use brew uninstall XYZ, e.g.\nbrew uninstall python\nSometimes you need to search for the software to get the spelling correct, try this\nbrew SEARCH?\nAlternatively, you can just google the name of the software and homebrew and you'll usually find an example in a forum post. Be careful cutting and pasting code from forum posts, make sure you understand what it does. Commands like brew install and the name of the library you are looking for is generally a safe operation; you can always brew uninstall if you don't like it.\nSome full software suites, or binaries are managed with brew cask, for example:\nbrew CASK INSTALL?\nOther packages outside the core are managed in seperate repositories you may need to tap. For example, some favorite scientific and geospatial repositories are here:\nBREW TAP?\n1) Conda\nManages packages (especially Python) in your Anaconda environment (curated by Anaconda - formerly Continuum IO). This system is used specifically to manage python libraries with the Anaconda installation\nTo install\nTo uninstall\nTo find\n2) Pip\nManages Python across your machine (curated by Python community). This environment is called the Cheese factory--a Monty Python reference, like many things Pythonic. Pip replaced easy_install. You will often see reference to both, use Pip for more consistent results.\n3) NPM\nManages your Node.js javascript packages\nThere are more coming down the pipe, and referenced in this guide, but it is worth using these for now.\n"},"ch2-scripting-languages.html":{"url":"ch2-scripting-languages.html","title":"CH2 - Scripting Languages","keywords":"","body":"CH 2 - Scripting (programming) languages\nI found the Python language via R. Specifically, I did the analyses for dissertation exclusively in R. When I was trying to develop a web interface to my results (pre R-Shiny), I stumbled across Ruby on Rails and RSRuby. As I followed the trail, I realized it was a fork of R2Py and wham, discovered Python. My first experience of PyCon was like walking into Lothlórien. It felt like an epiphany at the time and I’ve never looked back.              \n\n\nPython and R\nWhy Python (my favorite language)\n\nIt’s relatively easy to get started\n\nYou get all the other languages you need with it (e.g. R, Scala, C)\n\nIt’s a Swiss Army Knife: you can do everything from web development to natural language to video games to to robotics and hacking\n\nOne ring to rule them all\n\n\nWhat About R\nR (another fantastic language) was written initially by statisticians for statisticians; in that capacity it is excellent. Indeed my univeristy stats proffessor was an early adopter. He'd grown tired of developing methods only to have to pay a license so his students could use an outdated version of his method. Unfortuntely, from teaching and training colleagues and students, I've found the learning curve can be needlessly steep, it is mostly limited to analytics, the input/output is excruciating, and  the parts don’t quite work together. However, if you are doing an analysis it is THE definitive source of packages and the dataframe concept is pure genius. RShiny has made it easy to share your results online, RStudio is slick, and the stats libraries are industry standard.\nInstalling R\nJust the core\nconda install -c r r-essentials\nAll the things\nbrew tap homebrew/science \nbrew install Rbrew install Caskroom/cask/rstudio\nPython vs R (moreso Python + R)\nI consider Python to be more versatile for my use case as a full-stack data scientist. So, how does one get the benefits of R without the hassles of R,\n1) Embed R in Python code to access the libraries\n2) Use Pandas dataframes in Python\nCalling R from Python\nconda install rpy2Jupyter notebook\nIn Jupyter\nPoint your browser to  http://localhost:8888/\nThen enter this into the first cell and press CMD⌘ + Enter`\n%load_ext rpy2.ipython\n%R X=c(1,4,5,7); sd(X); mean(X)\nThis should return\narray([ 4.25])\n\nPandas DataFrames\nPandas Dataframes revolutionized the Python workflow and were an R-killer for me. Beyond dataframes, I find Pandas is THE most useful framework for analytics in Python. A DataFrame can be conceptualized like a souped up Excel spreadsheet. You have a grid with rows and columns of data, except the cells can contain diverse of types of information, beyond a simple value, e.g. arrays, lists, dictionaries. A DataFrame consists of 3 keys components: the data, the index, and the columns.\nThe definiative guide to Pandas is written by Wes Mckinney, the author of the package/concept.

What the? How?\nWhy?\nI wrote my dissertation with a specific set of tools and libraries. Five years later, when I finally wanted to publish the last chapter, I could barely run the scripts. The setup time was a massive obstacle to make a quick revision. It got me wondering, what if I’d had a perfect snapshot of that environment, a version of R and the Gibbs sampler (JAGS) I was using, frozen in time. So I’d just need to spin it up make a tweak and go. Indeed a new release had been issued which broke other dependencies and ultimately gave different results. Hmmm, reproducible science much?\nVirtual Machines (VMs) allow you to freeze an environment. You can stick them on a USB and spin them up later. These also work great for teaching workshops or running hackathons.; however, they take up masses of space and can be flakey.\nContainers are like the ingredients for a VM but can be run on demand. There is less space, they don’t consume compute resources when not in use, and you can find VMs already entirely setup for data science.\nDocker is an excellent example\nhttps://www.docker.com/what-docker\nThis resource from Jupyter has fully configured environments for data science.
